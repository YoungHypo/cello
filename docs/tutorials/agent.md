# Lesson 3: Agent

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to set up a *Hyperledger Cello* agent on your computer.

**Remember: You can totally follow this lesson on a different machine from where you follow the last lesson i.e.**
**The agents can be on a different machine from the server.**

See also: [*Concepts*](../concepts.md).

## Image
### Agent

First, we have to build the image of the agent by running

```bash
make docker-rest-agent
```

The image will be tagged as `hyperledger/cello-agent-docker:latest`.

## Start the Agent

Next, start the agent by running

```bash
make agent
```

If nothing goes wrong, you should see a container named `cello-docker-agent` running on your computer by executing

```bash
docker ps
```

## Conclustion
That's it! You have successfully run a *Hyperledger Cello* agent on your computerðŸŽ‰.

In the next lesson, we'll talk about how you can create an organization and its first administrator.

See you thenðŸ‘‹!

## P.S. The "Quickstart" Way
Alternatively, you can run
```bash
make local
```

to set up a *Hyperledger Cello* server and agent in the same place as quick as possible.

However, in order to give you a deeper understanding of how everything works, 
we instead walked through the entire setup step-by-step in this tutorial.
